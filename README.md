Develop an election vote casting application as follows: There are two candidates A and B contesting in an election. There are five electorates and each electorate can cast their vote only once and for only one of the two candidates. The vote cast by an electorate is a character 'A' or 'B', sent as a multicast to all other electorates. The winner is the candidate who gets the maximum number of votes. After casting the cote and also receiving vote messages from all other electorates, each electorate should be able to independently determine the winner and display it.
